DA-Street
=========

This repository contains code for DA-Street which was an online virtual stock market game. I coded it in 2012 for a college event. The price movement is determined by the activities of the users and not by the market movements.
I couldn't add details with individual commits. In case you decide to use it, feel free to contact me about what does each file do.
